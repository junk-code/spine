# Manifesto A

Hello world. This is a document that will be written and overwritten as I change and my priorities change. You are free to read this, however the views expressed are mine alone and not those of my employer or those of my friends. If you want the views of those folks go and talk to them. This is my document.

# Technology 1

As a human of my shape, I am able to interact with machines. However, the methods by which I interact with machines are extremely similar to those of a writer. Computers have a long and close history with the written word, and if you can find the words, the meaning of what you write can be understood by all. 

Computer languages thus far are us writing love letters to computers. Lately, with machine learning algorithms, we allow computers to come up with their own assumptions about the world around them and then we have a conversation about what they saw. 

We are changing the way that we interact with computers in very visceral way. I believe that I would enjoy a shared visual understanding of a program. I want to use my senses to understand how a program is running and not just read a document of how something is doing. Show me the ungulating work that a computer is doing. Let me glide over the logical pathways and alterations of state that computers show. Place into my hands the tools that allow me to make other tools. Let me share the tools I make with others. As technology grows, let my tools adapt automatically and take advantage of them. Let us share computing power when we feel like it.

Imagine a concert, thousands of people with phones login to a website (if they want to) and the shared computing power of those visitors help to render the visuals and effects on the screen. 

Imagine a concert.

At home, the users can take the data of the concert and make things with it. Imagine if you had the exact beats of your favorite drummer, the sick guitar licks of that super cool person over there. A concert in pieces. Imagine remixing a show live, perhaps providing lenses that you can view the experience through.

This is only one idea. More thoughts will be added to this document in order to further clarify this idea and provide others.
