```
Potential Workflow:

[local machine]
Write custom code for a theme or a module.
Push our code to a central cloud repo on github dedicated to that theme or module.

[remote test server]
cd [drupal directory]
composer update (automatically pulls down our changes from github and puts them where we want.)

```
