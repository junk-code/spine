# Installing Drush

You want the Drush Launcher, as it automatically uses the local Drupal's specified version of Drush
so that all Drush commands are routed properly instead of having to type /vendor/bin/drush all the time.

In order to enable the Drush Launcher Self Update feature, you may need ensure that the folder that you
put Drush is able to be written by you. see: chmod
